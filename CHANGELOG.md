# 0.1.0 (2019-05-30)

`compare` implements comparison between common go types

This is the first proper release of `compare`. In preparation for go 1.13, in which `go.mod` files and go modules are the primary way to handle go dependencies, we are going to do an official release of all our modules. This will be version v0.1.0 of `compare`.
